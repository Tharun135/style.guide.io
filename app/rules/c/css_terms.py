    Checks for proper usage of 'Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)' vs. references to style sheets.

    Guidelines:
    1. Capitalize references to the technique: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
    2. Spell out unless the abbreviation CSS is familiar to the audience.
    3. Lowercase references to style sheets created using the technique.
    4. Don't use 'CSS' to refer to a specific cascading style sheet. Use 'the CSS file', 'the cascading style sheet', or 'the style sheet'.
